# Lost Ark Data Recorder

This is a small app I built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for recording data to analyze drop rates for daily activities in Lost Ark (analysis [here](https://github.com/justinmooney/lost-ark-farming-analysis)). The data is saved in a few CSV files under `app/data/histories`.

I've used Streamlit for some simple dashboarding before but I wanted to try and flex it for something a bit more complex. Overall it worked pretty well and I was able to do much more than I expected, but overall the lack of customizability and reactivity (without extension) was a little disappointing. 

## To start:
```
$> streamlit run app/start.py
```
